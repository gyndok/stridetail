# Deviations from the plan

Conservative calls made while executing plans autonomously. Newest at the bottom.

## Task 1 — scaffold (2026-08-23)

- `create-expo-app` refuses non-empty directories, so it was run in a scratch dir and only
  `package.json`, `app.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `assets/`, `.vscode/` were copied in. Template
  README/AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md/LICENSE/.claude were not copied (would clobber repo `CLAUDE.md`).
- `bun run reset-project` was not run: the SDK 57 template's reset script is interactive
  (readline prompt) and moves things into `example/`, not `app-example/`. Equivalent outcome
  achieved by not copying the template's `src/` and `scripts/` at all. `reset-project` script
  removed from `package.json`.
- SDK 57 template places routes in `src/app/`; the plan specifies a root `app/` directory with
  `@/*` → `./*`. Followed the plan (root `app/`). Expo Router uses root `app/` when `src/app/`
  is absent.
- Test tooling (`jest-expo`, `jest`, `@types/jest`, `@testing-library/react-native`,
  `react-test-renderer`) moved from `dependencies` (where `expo install` put them) to
  `devDependencies`.
- `tsconfig.json` adds `"types": ["jest"]`: the template ships TypeScript 6.0, which no longer
  auto-includes `@types/*`, so `bun run typecheck` failed on `test`/`expect` without it.
- Kept template `experiments.reactCompiler: true`, `userInterfaceStyle`, icon/splash/adaptiveIcon
  entries from the generated `app.json` alongside the plan's identity fields.
- "`bunx expo start --web` shows Stridetail" check replaced by a non-interactive
  `expo export --platform web`, which produced the `/` route and a bundle containing "Stridetail".
